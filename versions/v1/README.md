## Frontend Version v1

This directory tracks **v1** of the AI Animation Studio Streamlit frontend.

- **Entry point in production:** the root `app.py` (used by Streamlit Cloud).
- **Purpose of this folder:** keep versioned notes, design docs, or experimental
  variants of the UI that correspond to the initial deployed version.

Future versions can live in sibling folders, e.g.:
- `versions/v2/` – updated UI/logic
- `versions/v3/` – further iterations

For now, there is no separate code entry in this folder; `app.py` represents v1.
